# Word Inflection Task

[An intro to word inflection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflection)

## Description

In this task, I implement a bi-LSTM sequence-to-sequence with attention model to approach the shared task of word reinflection from [CoNLL-SIGMORPHON shared task 2017](https://github.com/sigmorphon/conll2017). Specifically, I apply my model on Spanish-medium data setting (1,000 training samples), and achieve validation word accuracy of 69.37%.
